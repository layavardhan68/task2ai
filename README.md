## 📊 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the **Titanic passenger dataset** to uncover patterns and insights using data analysis and visualization techniques. It provides an intuitive understanding of the data, such as passenger demographics, survival distribution, and relationships between variables.

---

### 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset (`titanic.csv`) contains details about passengers aboard the Titanic, including:

* Passenger ID, Name, Sex, Age
* Ticket class (Pclass), Fare
* Cabin, Embarked port
* Number of siblings/spouses and parents/children aboard
* Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

---

### 🎯 Objectives

* Understand the structure and quality of the dataset
* Visualize distributions of key variables
* Analyze relationships between features (e.g., survival vs. gender/class)
* Detect missing data and outliers
* Generate both static and interactive visual summaries

---

### 🔍 Key Exploratory Steps

1. **Data Overview**

   * Preview dataset
   * Summary statistics
   * Identify missing values

2. **Univariate Analysis**

   * Distribution of numeric features (e.g., Age, Fare)
   * Frequency of categorical features (e.g., Sex, Embarked)

3. **Bivariate Analysis**

   * Correlations between numeric features
   * Relationships like Survival vs. Sex, Age vs. Class
   * Box plots and comparison charts

4. **Interactive Visualization**

   * Dynamic scatter plots (e.g., Age vs Fare)
   * Interactive histograms segmented by categories

5. **Missing Data Analysis**

   * Visual representations of missing fields
   * Identify patterns of null values

---

### 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

* **Pandas**: For data loading and transformation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For high-quality static plots
* **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations
* **Missingno**: For visualizing missing data

---

### ✅ Outcome

By the end of this analysis, you’ll have a clearer picture of:

* Who was more likely to survive (by age, class, sex, etc.)
* Which variables are most related to survival
* Which features have missing or inconsistent values
* Potential areas for further feature engineering or model development
